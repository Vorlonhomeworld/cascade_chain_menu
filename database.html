<b>How to utilize the HoH Roster</b><br><br>

<div class="rcorners1"><br><br>

If the caller insists that they're the HoH and the account is a Medicaide account, then they may be listed in the HoH roster. The following steps will help to determine if a discrepancy exists<br><br>

</div><br><br>

<div class="rcorners2"><br><br>

<b>1.</b> From the main onContact Window, select the help menu:

<img src="hoh1.jpg"><br><br>

<b>2.</b> Select "Documentation"<br><br>

<img src="hoh2.jpg"><br><br>

<b>3</b> Make sure the files are sorted by the <b>"Date Modified"</b> as seen in <b>1</b> below.  Select the appropriate HoH roster for the type of account being opened. The most up to date roster will be listed with the most recent molnth in the name. For normal Medicaid accounts, select the roster without <b>HARP</b> in it, as seen in <b>2</b>:<br><br>

<img src="hoh3.jpg"><br><br>

<b>4.</b> You may get the following message when opening the file. In this case, select <b>"Read Only"</b> to open the file<br><br>

<img src="hoh4.jpg"><br><br>

<b>5.</b> To find the ID needed in the roster: First click the home tab along the top of the tabs <b>(1)</b>. Then select <b>"Find & Select"(2)</b> and click <b>"Find" (3)</b>:<br><br>

<img src="hoh5.jpg"><br><br>

<b>6.</b> Enter the ID and click <b>"Find Next:</b><br><br>

<img src="hoh6.jpg"><br><br>

<b>7.</b>The ID will be found and dispalyed as shown here if it's available on the HoH roster. If it is not found or the caller is not listed under case name, then you must ask for an authorized party to verify demographics before continuing with the call<br><br>

<img src="hoh7.jpg"> <br><br>

<b>8.</b> If an unlisted HOH is found in the roster, then you may assist the caller with the account after demographics are verified. The code <b> E13A</b> must be documented after the call to notate the HoH discrepancy as shown here with the reason for the call and the following information if available:<br>
-HOH's name <br> 
-HOH's DOB<br>
-HOH's relationship to the member<br>

<b>Qualifying life events</b><br><br>
<div class="rcorners1"><br><br>
The member/prospect must answer yes to at least one of these questions to qualify for QHP or Total EPO outside the open enrollment period that goes from November 1st to January 31st. <br><br>

Have you or your spouse lost your insurance ? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> NOTE:</b> This does NOT apply if the lsot insurance was QHP/EPO and due to non-payment <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A member that lost their PHSP (MA, CHP, EP) or COBRA has a 60 day special enrollment period (SEP)<br>
&nbsp;Unbsp;from the time they were disenrolled in which they may apply for their leaf plans or Total EPO. <br><br>

If yes to one of these questions, then the prosepct/member qualifies for a special enrollment period going out 60 days from that event. Schedule the appointment, but if they're cutting it close to apply within the 60 day SEP, then suggest a walk in or applying online to be safe. <br><br>

<b>NOTE:</b> If the caller <i>insists</i> they should have a QLE , then check the below list as well, and remember that this MUST have happened within 60 DAYS of the event for it to be a QLE:<br><br>

<b>Total EPO proceedure</b><br><br><br><br>

<div class="rcorners1"><br><br>

<b> What is Total EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization)</b><br><br>

Total EPO is an insurance plan that allows access to health care from an in network physician, facility, or other health care professional including specialists, without designating a Primary Care Physician (gatekeeper) or obtaining a referral. Both HMO and EPO do not provider care out of the network except in Emergencies. <br>
Total EPO is an off-exchange non state-managed plan. Thus all members/prospects have to be addressed by HealthFirst and not by any government agency <br>
If a prospect's employer sent the prospect to HealthFirst to sign up for Total EPO and the employer is paying for the insurance, then warm transfer the caller to broker services:  855 456-3668 M-F 9 AM to 5 PM. <br>
If an employer calls in looking for Total EPO for their employees, in addition to themselves, potentially, then warm transfer the caller to Employer Serices 855 949-3668 M-F 9 Am to 5 PM <br>
Otherwise, if the prospect is applying for Total EPO themselves, or just for their family, with no employees involved, and they will be paying for it themselves as well then continue below:

<b> Total EPO service areas </b><br><brf>

1. Bronx<br>
2. Brooklyn <br>
3. Manhattan <br>
4. Nassau <br>
5. Queens <br>
6. Staten Island <br>

<h2> Telephonic vs physical appointment grid  </h2><br><br>
<img src="tvp1.jpg"><br>
<div class="rcorners1"><br><br>
<b><u>Introduction</b></u><br><br>


This grid provides a quick reference for scheduling <b>PHSP (Medicaid, CHP and PWP), Essential Plan, Qualified Health Plan</b> and <b>Total EPO</b><u> telephonic,</u><u>physical</u> or <u>phone</u> appointments. While this grid does not contain every possible scenario, it should cover the vast majority. <br><br>


<!-- Per an email from Charity Jones on 12/4/2018 9:00 AM  -->

<b><u>NOTICE:</b></u> This new job aid doesn't reflect the updated for OEP (Open Enrollment Period). We are still rescheduling missed appointments for telephonic renewals. Do not transfer to the telephonic team, reschedule the appontment. Also we are still scheduling telephonic appointments for all plans during OEP. If you have any more questions please <a href="mailto:charity.jones@sutherlandglobal.com"> let me know. </a><br><br>
